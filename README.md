# task-3
Task 3 focuses on using SQL to extract, analyze, and interpret data from a database. The goal is to understand how to write efficient SQL queries that help derive insights from structured data. You will work with an Ecommerce dataset and perform operations such as filtering, joining tables, applying aggregate functions, writing subqueries, and creating views. This task helps build a strong foundation in database querying and analytical thinking.

✅ Process Overview
1. Load the Dataset

Import the ecommerce dataset into a database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

2. Understand the Schema

Review the table structure (columns like product, price, quantity, order_date) to understand what kind of analysis can be performed.

3. Write SQL Queries

Use SQL commands to explore and analyze data:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT

Different types of JOIN

Subqueries for deeper analysis

Creating views to simplify complex queries

4. Optimize Queries

Use indexes or rewrite queries to improve performance where needed.

5. Capture Output
